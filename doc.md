**# Project overview**
building an exact Yelp clone in Iran named Kasbiyar with the added feature of enabling businesses to sell their products and services. The focus will be on creating a scalable, user-friendly, secure, and feature-rich platform with modern features, a top-notch UI/UX, and more functionality can be a complex but rewarding project. We want all text to be farsi and all webpages to be an exact replica of Yelp webpages. Kasbiyar is an innovative digital platform designed to connect people with the best local businesses in their area. Unlike traditional listing platforms, Kasbiyar combines the power of business listings, product sales, and customer reviews to foster community engagement and drive growth for businesses across Iran. Our goal is to empower local businesses with tools and visibility to expand their reach, attract more customers, and succeed in today’s digital world.

**# Core functionalities**
User Profiles: Users should be able to create accounts, manage profiles, and track their activity.
Badges & Achievements: Reward users for engaging with the platform by creating a gamified experience. Users can earn badges for leaving reviews, visiting businesses, or recommending shops to others.
Custom Avatars: Let users create fun, customizable avatars that represent them within the Kasbiyar ecosystem. The more businesses they interact with or review, the more customization options they unlock.
Personalized Recommendations: Use machine learning to create hyper-personalized recommendations. The platform can show businesses that match users' preferences, recent searches, or reviews left by people with similar interests.
Business Listings: Businesses should be able to list their services with information like descriptions, images, contact info, operating hours, etc.
3D Storefronts: Create an option for businesses to showcase a 3D model of their store or environment, giving users a virtual tour or sense of the physical space, creating a more immersive experience.
Live Chat with Owners: Allow users to directly chat with business owners through Kasbiyar. Implement an easy-to-use messaging system so users can ask about product availability, services, or directions.
Unique Rating Criteria: Instead of standard star ratings, allow users to rate businesses based on creative categories like “Friendliest Staff,” “Most Unique Products,” “Best Ambiance,” or “Hidden Gem.”
List of Businesses:Interactive Map of Businesses: Instead of a static list, create an interactive, visually appealing map where businesses are highlighted with colorful pins, badges, or icons based on categories or user reviews. When hovered over, the map could display mini pop-ups with business details.
Dynamic Statistics: Showcase real-time stats, such as "X new businesses joined today" or "Y customers discovered new businesses this week," giving users a sense of community activity.
User-Generated Stories: Feature a section where users and business owners can share success stories. Let these stories include photos, short videos, or quotes to make them personal and engaging.
Reviews and Ratings: Allow users to review businesses and give ratings (star system or others).
Search & Filter: Enable users to search for businesses by location, category, price range, and other filters.
Emotion-Based Search: Allow users to search for businesses based on how they feel. For example, they could search for “Cozy spots” or “Adventurous experiences” instead of just business categories.
Visual Search: Implement an AI-powered visual search feature where users can upload a picture (for example, a product or interior design they like), and Kasbiyar will find similar businesses or products locally.
Map Integration: Use maps (like Google Maps) to help users find businesses.
Photos & Media: Businesses and users should be able to upload images, and users can browse photo galleries.
Geolocation & Mobile Support: Users should be able to use geolocation to find nearby businesses.
Booking & Reservations: Allow users to book services (restaurants, salons, etc.) via the platform.
Ads & Promotions: Businesses can pay for better placement or featured listings.
Review Sorting and Filtering: Allow users to filter reviews based on recency, star ratings, or relevance. You can also implement a verified badge for businesses or users who leave high-quality reviews.
Video Reviews: Let users leave short video reviews along with text. A video adds a personal touch and conveys emotion and authenticity that text alone often can’t capture.
Interactive Voting on Reviews: Allow users to vote on reviews not only for their helpfulness but also for categories like "most creative," "funniest," or "most insightful."
Review Themes: Allow businesses to set a “theme” for the month where they ask users to focus their reviews on specific aspects like customer service, product quality, or ambiance. This engages the community to interact around specific topics.
Review Summaries: For businesses, show a summary of reviews at the top (e.g., average rating, most common phrases used in reviews).
Upvoting/Downvoting Reviews: Let users upvote helpful reviews and downvote irrelevant or spammy ones. This ensures that the best reviews appear at the top.
Enable real-time notifications for users when their reviews get a response, or if there are new updates about a business they follow.
Freemium Model with Upsell Opportunities: Allow businesses to start for free with basic features, then offer upsell opportunities for advanced features, such as enhanced listings, better analytics, or priority in search results.
Sponsored Listings: Allow businesses to pay for premium placement in search results or on homepage banners, creating another revenue stream.
Improved Product Listings: Allow businesses to add more detailed product descriptions, multiple images, and customer reviews for each product they sell on the platform.
Streamlined Checkout Process: Improve the user checkout experience, making it faster and more secure, with integrations for popular payment gateways in Iran.
Order Tracking and Support: Give customers the ability to track their orders and communicate with the business for post-sale support.
Shipping Integration: If applicable, integrate shipping options where users can choose preferred delivery methods, calculate costs, and track their deliveries.


**# Doc**
Simplicity: Make navigation simple and fast. Users should find what they’re looking for within 3 clicks.
Mobile-first: Given that a large portion of users in many regions access the internet through mobile devices, a responsive, mobile-friendly design should be a priority. The experience should be fluid and optimized for different screen sizes.
Visual Consistency: Use consistent colors, fonts, and styles across all platforms. Follow modern design trends, but ensure usability.
Microinteractions: Add small animations or transitions for elements like buttons, form inputs, and loading screens to make the experience smoother.
Engagement-focused: Focus on keeping users engaged with easy access to features, a clean profile page, and gamification elements like badges or leaderboards.
User-generated content emphasis: Make it easy for users to post reviews, upload photos, and interact with content without excessive steps.
Rating Visualization: Use clear, visual ratings (e.g., stars, bar graphs) so users can quickly assess reviews.
Voice Search: Add a voice search option to enhance accessibility and convenience.
Feedback: Implement tools for users to suggest new features or report issues.
Business Owners: Simplify the process of signing up, creating listings, and managing their storefront.
Shoppers: Make it easy to search, browse, and purchase from local businesses.
Both business owners and customers should find the platform easy to use. Reduce complexity by minimizing clicks and offering a straightforward user interface (UI).
Simple navigation bar with clear, concise labels.
Easy-to-access dashboards for both sellers and buyers.
Focus on important actions like adding products, checking sales, or making purchases.
Lazy loading of images and asynchronous loading of resources.
Compress images and scripts.
Ensure that your platform is optimized for search engines and is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.
Implement proper meta tags, headings, and schema markup for SEO.
Follow Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to make the platform usable by a wider audience.
Improve the visual hierarchy by making the call-to-action buttons more prominent with larger sizes and contrasting colors. Use consistent font styles for headings, buttons, and links to make them easily distinguishable.
Implement breadcrumb navigation to guide users through the multi-step processes and reduce confusion. This can help users know where they are and how to navigate back.
Implement real-time form validation and error messages that inform users when inputs are incorrect, guiding them to fix the errors effectively.
Search Bar Feedback: The search bar should provide immediate feedback. You can implement real-time suggestions as the user types. This feature makes it easier to find cities and gives a feeling of responsiveness. Also, include a clear button (X) to reset the search input.
Loading Feedback: When a user searches for a city, you can display a loading indicator or a message like "Loading..." if the query takes time. This reassures users that their request is being processed.
No Results Found: If the search yields no results, display a friendly message, e.g., "No cities found. Please try another search."
Input Size and Tapping Area: Ensure the search input field is large enough on mobile to comfortably type. Also, make the tappable areas (e.g., search button, city links) large enough for fingers to tap without accidental clicks.
Autocomplete: Enable autocomplete in the search bar to allow users to see previously searched cities or auto-filled city names. This reduces typing effort.
Branding Consistency: Make sure that our logo, typography, and color scheme are aligned across all pages. The identity of the site should be clear from the first interaction.
Make the sign-up and login process seamless. Use social login options (Google, Facebook) to speed up onboarding.
Implement guided tours or tooltips for first-time users to highlight key features like searching for businesses, leaving reviews, or finding top-rated places.
Microinteractions: Use subtle animations for hover effects on buttons, loading spinners, or notifications to give feedback to the user without overloading the page.
Optimize Images: Use WebP format for images, and make sure images are responsive and compressed without losing quality.
Use SSR for checkout flow to ensure cart data is secure.
Ensure all pages have proper meta tags for SEO (title, description, OpenGraph tags, etc.).
Use server-side rendering (SSR) for dynamic pages like business listings to ensure they are crawled effectively by search engines.
